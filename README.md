Type of data:
+ Structured data
  
  Structured data is data that has been organized into a formatted repository, typically a database, so that its elements can be made addressable for more effective processing and analysis.

  In a database, for example, each field is discrete and its information can be retrieved either separately or along with data from other fields, in a variety of combinations. The power of the database is its ability to make data comprehensive, so that it yields useful information. A database query language, such as [SQL (standard query language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), allows a database administrator to interact with the database. 

  Example: Financial data, point of sale data, customer data (name, address, phone number, e-mail, occupation,...), [CRM system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer-relationship_management), [ERP system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning), relational database,...
+ Unstructure data and Semi-structured Data

  Unstructure data is information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in fielded form in databases or annotated (semantically tagged) in documents.
  
  Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. Therefore, it is also known as [self-describing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code) structure.
  
  According to estimates, 80% of business-relevant information that original from unstructured data and semi-structured data. Example about them consist of:
  + Image
  + Audio
  + Video
  + [Graphics model](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/graphical-models) 
  + Webite
  + Text and documentation file like email, posts on social networks, text file extensions, Blog,... 
  + Presentation software
  + Application
  + Data warehouses, data lake
  + NoSQL database
  + NLP processing
  
  **Unstructured data is intersection point of structured data and semi-structured data. **

+ Internal data
+ External data
