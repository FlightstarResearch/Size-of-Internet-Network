Type of data in [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data) analytics:
+ Structured data
  
  Structured data is data that has been organized into a formatted repository, typically a database, so that its elements can be made addressable for more effective processing and analysis.

  In a database, for example, each field is discrete and its information can be retrieved either separately or along with data from other fields, in a variety of combinations. The power of the database is its ability to make data comprehensive, so that it yields useful information. A database query language, such as [SQL (standard query language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), allows a database administrator to interact with the database. 

  Example: Financial data, point of sale data, customer data (name, address, phone number, e-mail, occupation,...), [CRM system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer-relationship_management), [ERP system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning), relational database,...
+ Unstructure data and Semi-structured Data

  Unstructure data is information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner. Unstructured information is typically text-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well. This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as compared to data stored in fielded form in databases or annotated (semantically tagged) in documents.
  
  Semi-structured data is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure of data models associated with relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless contains tags or other markers to separate semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. Therefore, it is also known as [self-describing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code) structure.
  
  According to estimates, 80% of business-relevant information that original from unstructured data and semi-structured data.

  Example about them consist of:
  + Image
  + Audio
  + Video
  + [Graphics model](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/graphical-models) 
  + Website
  + Text and documentation file like email, posts on social networks, text file extensions, Blog,... 
  + Presentation software
  + Application
  + Data warehouses, data lake
  + NoSQL database
  + NLP processing

  **Unstructured data is intersection point of structured data and semi-structured data.** This data type can include some the structured in applying analysis, but haven't absolute data model yet. For the semi-structured data, we used to tag or the other bookmark form to determine certain elements in the data, but the data don't have a certain structure. For example, posts in the Facebook can be classified to author, data, length of data, sentimental level, but in the general the content of them still semi-unstructured.
    
+ Internal data

  Internal data is data retrieved from inside the company to make decisions for successful operations. This information is important to determine whether the strategies the company is currently using are successful or if shifts should be made. There are four different areas a company can gather internal data from: **[Sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales), [finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance), [marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing), and [human resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources)**.
  
  Example:
  + Customers response data 
  + Sales data
  + Employee and customer survey data
  + Video of the security camera data
  + Transaction data
  + Customer profile data
  + Inventory control data
  + HR data
+ External data:

  External data is infinite chain of information and data that is stored outside the current database of the business. The external data can be public data or private data. 
  
  The public data available to everyone to use and republish as they wish by the way like free, payment for third party or hire the third party to collect data.

  The private data is that are not made available to the general public, such as passwords and financial account details. The private data sometime requires you have to find data resource and payment for some the company or third party specialize in providing data
  
  The example for external data:
  + Weather data
  + Government data like the survey for population
  + Twitter data
  + Social network profiles data
  + Google Trend or Google Map
